TITLE: Simple Programs in Java AIM: To write simple programs in Java to 
i) To Find Factorial of Number. 
ii) To Display First 50 Prime Numbers 
iii) To Find Sum and Average of N Numbers. 

THEORY: Object-oriented programming(OOP) is at the core of Java. In fact, all Java programs are to at least some extent object-oriented. 
As a language that has the Object Oriented feature, 
Java supports the following fundamental concepts: · Polymorphism · Inheritance · Encapsulation · Abstraction · Classes · Objects · Instance · Method · 

Message Parsing Objects in Java: Objects have states and behaviors.If we consider the real-world,
we can find many objects around us such as Cars, Dogs, Humans, etc. All these objects have a state and behavior.
If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking, wagging, running. 
If you compare the software object with a real world object, they have very similar characteristics. 
Software objects also have a state and behavior. A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods. 
So in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the object-to-object communication is done via methods. 
Classes in Java: A class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.

A sample of a class is given below:
java
public class Dog {
    String breed;
    int age;
    String color;
    void barking() {
    }
    void hungry() {
    }
    void sleeping() {
    }
}

Variables: The variable is the basic unit of storage in a Java program.A variable is defined by the combination of an identifier,
a type, and an optional initializer. In addition, all variables have a scope, which defines their visibility, and a lifetime. 
A class can contain any of the following variable types. · Local variables: Variables defined inside methods,
constructors or blocks are called local variables. 
The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed. 
· Instance variables: Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method. 
These variables are instantiated when the class is loaded. Instance variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor or blocks of that particular class. 
· Class variables: Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.
A class can have any number of methods to access the value of various kinds of methods. In the above example,
barking(), hungry() and sleeping() are methods. Declaring a Variable: In Java,all variables must be declared before they can be used. 
The basic form of a variable declaration is shown here: type identifier [ = value][, identifier [= value] ...]; 
The type is one of Java’s atomic types, or the name of a class or interface. The identifier is the name of the variable.
You can initialize the variable by specifying an equal sign and a value. Keep in mind that the initialization expression must result in a value of the same 
(or compatible) type as that specified for the variable. To declare more than one variable of the specified type, 
use a comma separated list. Here are several examples of variable declarations of various types. Note that some include an initialization.


java
int a, b, c;         // declares three ints, a, b, and c.
int d = 3, e, f = 5; // declares three more ints, initializing d and f.
byte z = 22;         // initializes z.

TITLE: Java Program for Inheritance 
AIM: To write a program in Java to inherit the classes cricket_player,
football_player and hockey_player from player class using the concept of inheritance.

THEORY: Inheritance: Inheritance can be defined as the process where one object acquires the properties of another.With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order. The most commonly used keyword in inheritance are extends and implements. 

Example:
java
// This program uses inheritance to extend Box.
class Box {
    double width;
    double height;
    double depth;

    // construct clone of an object
    Box(Box ob) { // pass object to constructor
        width = ob.width;
        height = ob.height;
        depth = ob.depth;
    }

    // constructor used when all dimensions specified
    Box(double w, double h, double d) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
        depth = d;
    }

    // constructor used when no dimensions specified
    Box() {
        width = -1;  // use -1 to indicate
        height = -1; // an uninitialized
        depth = -1;  // box
    }

    // constructor used when cube is created
    Box(double len) {
        width = height = depth = len;
    }

    // compute and return volume
    double volume() {
        return width * height * depth;
    }
}

// Here, Box is extended to include weight.
class BoxWeight extends Box {
    double weight; // weight of box

    // constructor for BoxWeight
    BoxWeight(double w, double h, double d, double m) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
        depth = d;
        weight = m;
    }
}

class DemoBoxWeight {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        BoxWeight mybox1 = new BoxWeight(10, 20, 15, 34.3);
        BoxWeight mybox2 = new BoxWeight(2, 3, 4, 0.076);
        double vol;
        vol = mybox1.volume();
        System.out.println("Volume of mybox1 is " + vol);
        System.out.println("Weight of mybox1 is " + mybox1.weight);
        System.out.println();
        vol = mybox2.volume();
        System.out.println("Volume of mybox2 is " + vol);
        System.out.println("Weight of mybox2 is " + mybox2.weight);
    }
}
The output from this program is shown here:
Volume of mybox1 is 3000.0
Weight of mybox1 is 34.3
Volume of mybox2 is 24.0
Weight of mybox2 is 0.076
BoxWeight inherits all of the characteristics of Box and adds to them the weight component. 
It is not necessary for BoxWeight to re-create all of the features found in Box. It can simply extend Box to meet its own purposes.
Using super: Whenever a subclass needs to refer to its immediate superclass,it can do so by use of the keyword super. super has two general forms. 
The first calls the superclass’ constructor. The second is used to access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.
        f1.show();
        h1.show();

    }
}

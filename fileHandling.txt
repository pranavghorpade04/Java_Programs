TITLE: Java Program for File Handling

AIM:
To write program in Java to read a data from one file and write in another file line by line.

THEORY:

Reading and Writing Files
Java provides a number of classes and methods that allow you to read and write files. 
Before we begin, it is important to state that the topic of file I/O is quite large and file I/O is 
examined in detail in Part II. The purpose of this section is to introduce the basic techniques that
read from and write to a file. Although bytes streams are used, these techniques can be adapted to the character-based streams.

Two of the most often-used stream classes are FileInputStream and FileOutputStream, which create byte streams 
linked to files. To open a file, you simply create an object of one of these classes, specifying the name of 
the file as an argument to the constructor. Although both classes support additional constructors, 
the following are the forms that we will be using:

FileInputStream(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileOutputStream(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException

Here, fileName specifies the name of the file that you want to open. When you create an input stream, 
if the file does not exist, then FileNotFoundException is thrown. For output streams, if the file 
cannot be opened or created, then FileNotFoundException is thrown. FileNotFoundException is a subclass
of IOException. When an output file is opened, any preexisting file by the same name is destroyed.

In situations in which a security manager is present, several of the file classes, including FileInputStream
and FileOutputStream, will throw a SecurityException if a security violation occurs when attempting to open
a file. By default, applications run via java do not use a security manager. For that reason, the I/O examples
in this book do not need to watch for a possible SecurityException. However, other types of applications
(such as applets) will use the security manager, and file I/O performed by such an application could 
generate a SecurityException. In that case, you will need to appropriately handle this exception.


When you are done with a file, you must close it. This is done by calling the close() method, 
which is implemented by both FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. 

It is shown here:
void close() throws IOException
Closing a file releases the system resources allocated to the file, allowing them to be used by another file.
Failure to close a file can result in “memory leaks” because of unused resources remaining allocated.

TITLE: Java Program for Matching Rectangles

AIM:
To write a program in Java to compare two rectangles on the basis of area and colour.

THEORY:

The General Form of a Class:
When you define a class, you declare its exact form and nature. You do this by specifying the data that it contains and 
the code that operates on that data. While very simple classes may contain only code or only data, most real-world classes
contain both. A class is declared by use of the class keyword.

A simplified general form of a class definition is shown here:

java
class classname {
    type instance-variable1;
    type instance-variable2;
    // ...
    type instance-variableN;

    type methodname1(parameter-list) {
        // body of method
    }
    type methodname2(parameter-list) {
        // body of method
    }
    // ...
    type methodnameN(parameter-list) {
        // body of method
    }
}
The data, or variables, defined within a class are called instance variables. The code is contained within methods.
Collectively, the methods and variables defined within a class are called members of the class. In most classes, 
the instance variables are acted upon and accessed by the methods defined for that class. Thus, as a general rule,
it is the methods that determine how a class’s data can be used. Variables defined within a class are called instance
variables because each instance of the class (that is, each object of the class) contains its own copy of these variables. 
Thus, the data for one object is separate and unique from the data for another.

All methods have the same general form as main(), which we have been using thus far. However, most methods will not be 
specified as static or public. Notice that the general form of a class does not specify a main() method. Java classes do
not need to have a main() method. You only specify one if that class is the starting point for your program. Further, 
applets don’t require a main() method at all.

Here is a complete program that uses the Box class:

java
/* A program that uses the Box class. Call this file BoxDemo.java */
class Box {
    double width;
    double height;
    double depth;
}

// This class declares an object of type Box.
class BoxDemo {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Box mybox = new Box();
        double vol;
        // assign values to mybox's instance variables
        mybox.width = 10;
        mybox.height = 20;
        mybox.depth = 15;
        // compute volume of box
        vol = mybox.width * mybox.height * mybox.depth;
        System.out.println("Volume is " + vol);
    }
}
Declaring Objects
As just explained, when you create a class, you are creating a new data type. You can use this type to declare objects
of that type. However, obtaining objects of a class is a two-step process. First, you must declare a variable of the
class type. This variable does not define an object. Instead, it is simply a variable that can refer to an object. 
Second, you must acquire an actual, physical copy of the object and assign it to that variable. You can do this using
the new operator. The new operator dynamically allocates (that is, allocates at run time) memory for an object and 
returns a reference to it. This reference is, more or less, the address in memory of the object allocated by new. 
  This reference is then stored in the variable. Thus, in Java, all class objects must be dynamically allocated.

In the preceding sample program, a line similar to the following is used to declare an object of type Box:

java
Box mybox = new Box();
This statement combines the two steps just described. It can be rewritten like this to show each step more clearly:

java
Box mybox;           // declare reference to object
mybox = new Box();   // allocate a Box object

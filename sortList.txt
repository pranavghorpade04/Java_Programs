TITLE: Java Program for Sorting a List of Integers and Names

AIM:
To write program in Java to sort i) List of integers ii) List of names. using Arrays and Strings.

THEORY:

ARRAYS:
An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name. Arrays of any type can be created and may have one or more dimensions.
A specific element in an array is accessed by its index. Arrays offer a convenient means of grouping related information.

One-Dimensional Arrays:
A one-dimensional array is, essentially, a list of like-typed variables. To create an array, you first must create an array variable of the desired type. 
The general form of a one-dimensional array declaration is
type var-name[];
Here, type declares the base type of the array. The base type determines the data type of each element that comprises the array. 
Thus, the base type for the array determines what type of data the array will hold. For example, the following declares an array named month_days with the type “array of int”:
int month_days[];

Although this declaration establishes the fact that month_days is an array variable, no array actually exists. 
In fact, the value of month_days is set to null, which represents an array with no value. To link month_days with an actual, 
physical array of integers, you must allocate one using new and assign it to month_days. new is a special operator that allocates memory.
The general form of new as it applies to one-dimensional arrays appears follows:
array-var = new type[size];

Here, type specifies the type of data being allocated, size specifies the number of elements in the array, and array-var is
the array variable that is linked to the array. That is, to use new to allocate an array, you must specify the type and number 
of elements to allocate. The elements in the array allocated by new will automatically be initialized to zero. This example allocates
a 12-element array of integers and links them to month_days.
month_days = new int[12];
After this statement executes, month_days will refer to an array of 12 integers. Further, all elements in the array will be initialized to zero.

It is possible to combine the declaration of the array variable with the allocation of the array itself, as shown here:
int month_days[] = new int[12];

Arrays can be initialized when they are declared. The process is much the same as that used to initialize the simple types.
An array initializer is a list of comma-separated expressions surrounded by curly braces. The commas separate the values of the array elements. 
The array will automatically be created large enough to hold the number of elements you specify in the array initializer. 
There is no need to use new. For example, to store the number of days in each month, the following code creates an initialized array of integers:

java
class AutoArray {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int month_days[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };
        System.out.println("April has " + month_days[3] + " days.");
    }
}
When you run this program, it prints the number of days in April. As mentioned, Java array indexes start with zero, so the number of days in April is month_days[3] or 30.

STRINGS:
Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. The Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings.
The first thing to understand about strings is that every string you create is actually an object of type String. Even string constants are actually String objects.

For example, in the statement
System.out.println("This is a String, too");
the string “This is a String, too” is a String constant.

The second thing to understand about strings is that objects of type String are immutable; once a String object is created, 
its contents cannot be altered. While this may seem like a serious restriction, it is not, for two reasons:

If you need to change a string, you can always create a new one that contains the modifications.

Java defines a peer class of String, called StringBuffer, which allows strings to be altered, so all
of the normal string manipulations are still available in Java.

Creating a String:
Strings can be constructed in a variety of ways. The easiest is to use a statement like this:
String myString = "this is a test";

Once you have created a String object, you can use it anywhere that a string is allowed.
For example, this statement displays myString:
System.out.println(myString);

Java defines one operator for String objects: +. It is used to concatenate two strings.
For example, this statement
String myString = "!" + " like " + "Java.";
results in myString containing “I like Java.”

TITLE: Java Program to Implement a Calculator 
AIM: To write program in Java to implement a calculator with simple arithmetic operations such as Add,Subtract, 
Multiply, Divide etc. using switch case and other simple Java statements. 

THEORY: DATA TYPES: 1. Primitive (Intrinsic) data types 2. Non-primitive (Derived) data types 
· Primitive (Intrinsic) Data Types: Primitive data types are non grouped pieces of data which can have only one value at a time. 
They are the simplest built in forms of data in Java. Other data types are made up of combination of primitive data types. 
Java initializes all primitive data types to default values if an initial value is not explicitly specified by the programmer. 
Integer and floating-point variables are initialized to 0. The char data type is initialized to null and Boolean data types are set to false.
The primitive data type keywords are as shown: 
· byte 
· short 
· int 
· long 
· char
· float
· double 
· boolean Integer Data Types: There are four integer data types:

byte, short, int, and long. Each can handle different ranges of numbers, as shown: 
Integer data type ranges: Type Length Minimum Value Maximum Value byte 8 bits -128 127 short 16 bits -32768 32767 int 32 bits -2,147,483,648 2,147,483,647 
long 64 bits -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 · byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer.
It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). 

· short: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive). 
· int: The int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -2,147,483,648 and a maximum value of 2,147,483,647 (inclusive).
For integral values, this data type is generally the default choice unless there is a reason (like the above) to choose something else. 
· long: The long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of
9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive). Use this data type when you need a range of values wider than those provided by int. 
Char Data Types: Type char is basically a 16-bit unsigned integer that represents a Unicode value.Each printable and nonprintable character has a Unicode value. 
Because Java stores all characters as Unicode, it can be used with virtually any written language in the world. 
Floating-Point Data Types: Type float designates that the variable is a single-precision,32-bit, floating-point number.
Type double is a double-precision, 64-bit floating-point number.

Example:
java
float m;
double n;
Double Data Types: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.For decimal values, 
this data type is generally the default choice. As mentioned above, this data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency.

Boolean Data Types: Type boolean can only have a value of true or false.Internal to Java, a Boolean value is a 1-bit logical quantity.
Boolean values are used in branching/looping statements to check validity of the logical expression included. In addition to the eight primitive data types listed above,
the Java programming language also provides special support for character strings via the java.lang.String class. Non-primitive (Derived) Data Types: (Content not fully provided in the original)
